		We chose to place the <script> tags in the body element instead
		of the head for a technical reason: the browser displays the page
		in a top-down fashion, creating the DOM elements as it comes 
		across them in th HTML document. By placing <script> tags at the
		end, the Javascript files will be one of the last things the page
		loads. Because JavaScript files are often very large and take
		a bit of time to load, we like to do that last so that the user will
		get visual feedback from the other elements as fast as possible.
